## Running Experiments

The project supports three different types of datasets.  
You can reproduce the experiments by running the corresponding MATLAB scripts below.

---

### 1. Synthetic Dataset (Sine Curve & Parabola)

To generate and run experiments on toy synthetic trajectories (sine curve and parabola), execute:

```matlab
./code/genData_main.m
```
### 2. SO(3) Rotation Dataset

To run experiments on the SO(3) rotation dataset, execute:
```matlab
./code/gen_so3_exper.m
```
### 3. Human Skeleton Dataset

To run experiments on the human skeleton motion dataset, execute:
```matlab
./code/script_run_ppcData.m
```
